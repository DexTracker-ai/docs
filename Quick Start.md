| ![bluechip tag](./public/1.png) |  Bluechip tokens are cryptocurrencies that are considered high-quality, reliable, and well-established, much like blue-chip stocks in traditional finance. <br> **Problem:** High risk from only holding low-quality tokens. <br>**Solution:** Encourages holding trusted assets → improves portfolio safety and credibility. |
| ![top10 tag](./public/2.png) | Percentage of all tokens bought by TOP10 traders. <br>**Problem:** Top holders may only hold risky or low-quality tokens → fake volume, poor portfolio health. <br>**Solution:** Encourages top holders to also hold trusted assets → increases trust, reduces manipulation. |
| ![snipers count](./public/3.png)       | Number of sniper bots that bought the token in the first few blocks after launch. <br>**Problem:** High sniper activity can indicate a bot-dominated or manipulated launch. <br>**Solution:** Helps identify unnatural interest early on → better risk assessment before entering. |
| ![smart wallets count](./public/4.png) | Number of known "smart wallets" (profitable or high-reputation wallets) buying the token. <br>**Problem:** Lack of smart money may suggest low-quality or unvetted project. <br>**Solution:** Tracks entry of smart actors → encourages following knowledgeable investors.         |
| ![net diff](./public/5.png)            | Net difference between token buys and sells in the last 1 minute. <br>**Problem:** Sudden sell pressure can indicate incoming dumps or rug pulls. <br>**Solution:** Real-time net flow helps monitor sentiment shifts → enables quick reaction.                                    |
| ![bundle tag](./public/6.png)          | Indicates a coordinated buy from multiple wallets (bundle/multi-wallet strategy). <br>**Problem:** Hidden coordination or manipulation via split wallets. <br>**Solution:** Reveals cluster behavior → transparency into real buyer intent.                                        |

| ![shrimp tag](./public/12.png)  | Wallets that bought less than \$1,000 worth of tokens. <br>**Problem:** Dominance of small retail buyers may signal low conviction or speculative hype. <br>**Solution:** Useful to gauge retail participation vs larger investor interest.        |
| ![fish tag](./public/13.png)    | Wallets that bought more than \$1,000 worth of tokens. <br>**Problem:** Lack of mid-size buyers may indicate missing organic interest. <br>**Solution:** Shows if the token is attracting serious, but not over-leveraged, capital.                |
| ![dolphin tag](./public/14.png) | Wallets that bought more than \$3,000 worth of tokens. <br>**Problem:** If absent, may suggest token lacks confidence from mid-high range buyers. <br>**Solution:** Tracks moderate-cap investors → gives early sign of institutional curiosity.   |

| Tag                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![bluechip owner tag](./public/16.png)   | Wallet holds recognized bluechip tokens. <br>**Problem:** Hard to judge wallet quality at a glance. <br>**Solution:** Signals that the wallet holds trusted assets → suggests experience or selectivity.                                                      |
| ![sandwich bot tag](./public/17.png)     | Wallet is identified as a sandwich bot based on transaction patterns. <br>**Problem:** Sandwich bots distort price and harm real traders. <br>**Solution:** Flags potentially harmful MEV actors → helps avoid misleading transaction signals.                |
| ![fresh wallet tag](./public/18.png)     | Wallet was created recently (e.g., last 7 days). <br>**Problem:** Fresh wallets are often used for farming, manipulation, or throwaway trades. <br>**Solution:** Adds context about wallet's credibility → helps filter low-trust activity.                   |
| ![holding duration tag](./public/19.png) | Shows how long the wallet held the token before selling (or current holding duration). <br>**Problem:** Without time context, it’s hard to know if a wallet is flipping or investing. <br>**Solution:** Holding time reveals conviction or bot-like behavior. |

Analyze price difference on each market to detect what side price will go earlier than anyone.

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![active exchange](./public/20.png)  | Exchange marked with a green border is the **active exchange** — the main reference point for price comparison. <br>**Problem:** Without a consistent base, spread data is ambiguous. <br>**Solution:** Clarifies which price is used as baseline for all spread checks. |
| ![price difference](./public/21.png) | Percentage difference between token price on this exchange vs the active one. <br>**Problem:** Arbitrage or latency can mislead users on true price direction. <br>**Solution:** Highlights where price is lagging or leading → helps detect early price movement.       |
| ![difference \$](./public/22.png)    | Estimated dollar value **inside the spread** (e.g., liquidity gap between exchanges). <br>**Problem:** Percent spread alone doesn't show trade opportunity size. <br>**Solution:** Reveals how much money is “sitting” between price gaps → useful for real arbitrage.   |
